## Core Message broker - RabbitMQ

1. ### What is RabbitMQ?

   RabbitMQ is a **message broker or queue manager** that implements the **AMQP protocol**. This means that he takes
   messages in a queue and sends them to consumers. A message can include any kind of information.

    - **Producer**: publishes a message to an exchange.
    - **Message**: any kind of information or data.
    - **Queue**: hold many messages, queue (first in, first out).
    - **Broker**: in our case the RabbitMQ, a broker can have many queues.
    - **Consumer**: is the system that receives the message from the broker.

   With a message broker, we can decouple [separate] our application easily. This means we use a microservice
   architecture.

   And Let's imagine that the Email Service is unavailable.

   That will not affect the other services, and the application still works.
